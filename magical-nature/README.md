### Node & NPM
- Node: Allows developers to write and run JavaScript applications on the server. Developers started using node.js to also write tools to help them with **local web development**.
- NPM: Is a simple command line interface that allows developers to **install and manage packages** on their local computers. There are all kinds of open-source **tools, libraries and frameworks** needed for moder development. Modern web development could simply not exist without a package manager.

##### Install Tools
In order to install required tools in our project, first we need to create our `package.json` file, for that we need to execute `npm init`
- sass: `npm install node-sass --save-dev`

###### Note:
- --save-dev: is `dev` dependencies that is used as a developer tool for development.
- --save: is a dependency that the project needs.
